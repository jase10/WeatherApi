# WeatherApi
To setup the project on your own system, you would first have to sign up the Weather API website and gain a free Access key
You would then need to go and changr the access key value in app.config to your own access key as they are unique
To use the framework ensure the relevant packages are reinstalled as tests may not run, 
Once you have done that, go to Weather Call manager and change the location you would like to get the current weather for 
You would then have to go to tests and change the values in there relevent to your location
