# WeatherApi
To setup the project on your own system, you would first have to sign up the Weather API website and gain a free Access key
You would then need to go and change the access key value in app.config to your own access key as they are unique.
To use the framework ensure the relevant packages are reinstalled as tests may not run, 
Once you have done that, go to Weather Call manager and change the location you would like to get the current weather for 
You would then have to go to tests and change the values in there relevent to your location. 
Using the api and your access and a location you want to get the current weather for, go to postman and use a get request with the URL to get the current weather for a particular location. Now you can create Unit Tests to test if the API works successfully.

In this project I have learnt how to create a test framework in c# to test an API and get specific data from the API. Due to what i have learnt on the project, it would speed up the process of creating the test framework which would allow me to do further tests about extensiveness of the API.
